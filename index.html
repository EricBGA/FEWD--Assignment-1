      Experience</h3>
      <p> I recently graduated from a Front-End Web Development course at
      General Assembly where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and how to
      be an awesome Front-End Web Developer!
      During my spare time, I enjoy senior water aerobics, pickling, and
      spending time with my goldfish, Jerry.
